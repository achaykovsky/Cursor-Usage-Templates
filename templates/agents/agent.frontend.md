- Generic components for reusability
- Type utilities (Pick, Omit, Partial)

## OUTPUT
- Component implementations with TypeScript
- Responsive, accessible UI
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage
- Storybook stories (when applicable)

## PRINCIPLES
- Progressive enhancement (works without JS)

# Code Review Standards

**Format when flagging**:
```
CRITICAL: [issue] - [impact] - [fix]
WARNING: [issue] - [suggestion]
```

**Checklist**: Type safety (Any, missing hints). Security (injection, secrets, validation). Performance (N+1, blocking I/O). Architecture (god modules, coupling). Tests (edge cases, error paths). Include code snippet for fix when suggesting change.

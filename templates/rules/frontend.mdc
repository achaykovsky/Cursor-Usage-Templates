# Frontend Standards

**React**: `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` for code splitting. `useMemo`/`useCallback` only when profiling shows need. Keys on list items = stable unique id.

**Accessibility**: `role`, `aria-label` when semantic HTML insufficient. `tabIndex` for focus order. `:focus-visible` for focus styles. Test with keyboard only, screen reader.

**Bundle**: `import()` for route-level splitting. Dynamic imports for heavy libs. Tree-shake: use named imports, not default. Check bundle analyzer output.

**State**: Server state → React Query/SWR. Local UI state → useState. Avoid prop drilling → context or composition. Derive state when possible.

**TypeScript**: `strict: true`. No `any`. `unknown` for untyped input. Discriminated unions for reducer/state. `satisfies` for inference with constraints.

# Cursor Usage Templates

Centralized Markdown templates for defining Cursor instructions at multiple scopes.

## Template scopes

- `templates/workspace.md` – baseline rules for the entire workspace or repository.
- `templates/project.md` – project-specific objectives, constraints, and workflows.
- `templates/user.md` – personal preferences for an individual collaborator.

## How to use

1. Copy the relevant template into your Cursor instructions panel.
2. Replace placeholders with concrete details.
3. Keep templates under version control so the team can iterate together.

These templates intentionally avoid language- or framework-specific guidance; add technical details only when a project demands them.
